# Motivation

To develop a strategy to obtain a common post-processing policy (data types and units)
for various codes in similar research cases. The examples of cases in question:

## Equation of State
   Computation and comparison of EOS calculated with different codes but same
   input given to a standardized workflow. Comparison parameters in this case
   are the curvatures (bulk moduli) and positions of minima of the calculated
   EOSes.

## Quasiharmonic Calculation of Phonons
   Obtaining phonons dispersion within quasiharmonic approximation for different
   codes. Proposed data types are built around the resulting band-structure
   information and values of force constants.
